print("say something")
#notes are used to tell yourself what your code is for
#You use print to display what you are doing or to show the solution to what you have done
#I will be finding the multiplication of 5 and 7. I will do this by keeping the equation in parenthesis which will show what I want python to execute. I will use an astarisk to represent multiplication in the term that python can use
print(5 * 7)
#a floatpoint divides a real number and an integer into a decimal
